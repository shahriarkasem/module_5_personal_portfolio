            <p>Some of us have naturally sunnier dispositions than others, but it's important to remember that a
                positive
                attitude and motivated approach are skills that can be learnt. So, forget New Year's resolutions about
                hitting the gym or quitting a bad habit, instead invest in cultivating a positive attitude and staying
                motivated; this approach could accelerate great things in your personal and professional life!</p>

            <p>After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?”
                After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web

                <br>
                Global Community
            </h3>
            <p>A global community is a rule-bound society of individual people who come together to share a particular
                set of concerns.

                People often identify with their culture and nation, but now they can also identify as participants in
                the "global community." This new identity is important because it opens up more avenues for constructive
                dialogue and facilitates possibilities for cooperation amongst those who would otherwise be competing
                rivals.

                Establishing common goals is one of the most effective ways to do this. Another tactic you might try is
                surrounding yourself with people who think similarly, or ones you know will push your thinking forward.
                One really cool way to do this: find a Quores user whose stance you disagree with and follow them
                instead!</p>

                <h3> Impact on the <span class="pink-color">Sundarban</span></h3>
                <p>Sundarbans is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest and is a designated world heritage site.
                    Shared by India and Bangladesh, it is home to several species including tigers. The habitat supports
                    approximately 4.37 million people. As per the research conducted it is believed that the Sundarbans
                    have
                    soaked in 4.15 crore tonnes of carbon dioxide. Due to climate change the Sundarbans faces several
                    challenges. With rising sea levels, islands are disappearing and the increasing salinity in the
                    water
                    and soil has severely threatened the health of mangrove forests and the quality of soil and crops.
                    Additionally, there have been serious disturbances to hydrological parameters and change in fishing
                    patterns, resulting in disastrous consequences for fishermen. Frequent cyclones and erratic monsoon
                    raining pattern are damaging ecology and humanity. In addition to general environment protection
                    laws,
                    India has also set up institutes at both the Central and State levels to specifically tackle the
                    effects
                    of climate change on Sundarbans. However, split responsibilities between Centre and States and
                    multitude
                    of institutions has resulted in overlap of responsibilities, loss of time and resources, which makes
                    the
                    institutions ineffective. With risk of the Sundarbans submerging, there is an urgent need for global
                    reduction of emissions and replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy. Governments also need
                    to
                    promote plantation of local saline resistant seeds. Even as the State and Central Government of
                    India
                    finalise action plans to tackle the problems of climate change and take steps for poverty
                    alleviation in
                    one of the world's poorest regions, there is a pressing requirement to set up flood relief centres
                    and
                    rapid action response teams to cyclones and storms.</p>
