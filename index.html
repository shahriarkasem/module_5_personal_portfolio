            <p>Some of us have naturally sunnier dispositions than others, but it's important to remember that a
                positive
                attitude and motivated approach are skills that can be learnt. So, forget New Year's resolutions about
                hitting the gym or quitting a bad habit, instead invest in cultivating a positive attitude and staying
                motivated; this approach could accelerate great things in your personal and professional life!</p>

            <h3>Develop <br> Without Limits</h3>
            <p>After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?”
                After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web
                developer positions asked for</p>

                <br>
                Global Community
            </h3>
            <p>A global community is a rule-bound society of individual people who come together to share a particular
                set of concerns.

                People often identify with their culture and nation, but now they can also identify as participants in
                the "global community." This new identity is important because it opens up more avenues for constructive
                dialogue and facilitates possibilities for cooperation amongst those who would otherwise be competing
                rivals.

                Establishing common goals is one of the most effective ways to do this. Another tactic you might try is
                surrounding yourself with people who think similarly, or ones you know will push your thinking forward.
                One really cool way to do this: find a Quores user whose stance you disagree with and follow them
                instead!</p>
